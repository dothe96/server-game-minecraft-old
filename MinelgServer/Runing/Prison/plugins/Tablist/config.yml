# Tablist v1.3.0.2 by sn1cko
# Time is set in milliseconds which means every 20 = 1 second
# for example: 6000 = 5 minuntes OR 300 = 15 seconds
# 
# The announcer will never stop if the time is set to 0
# Else it will stop after the amount of milliseconds you wish
# 
# There are currently 15 variables available which can be built in
# for example %player% - will display the playername or %health% - will give out the health
# all other variables can be found on the website
