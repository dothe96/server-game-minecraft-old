# AutoSell shop_multipliers.yml file
# This file allows you to create custom multipliers that can be attached to players or groups by permission
# 
# These multipliers will only take effect in the shops listed for the multiplierThe format for a multiplier must follow this format:
# <unique identifier>:
#   priority: <unique number>
#   permission: <your custom permission for this multiplier>
#   multiplier: <the multiplier amount>
#   shops:
#   - 'shop1'
#   - 'shop2'
# 
# You can list as many multipliers you like.
# Each multiplier must have a unique priority set!!!
# The priority determines what multiplier comes first in your list
# If a player happens to have permission for many multipliers
# the lowest number priority will always be applied if that multiplier has the shop listed the player
# is trying to sell to!
